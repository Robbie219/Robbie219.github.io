        <p class="instruction">Arundo Donax (reed cane) comes in the form of various sized tubes. First, I sort for tubes that have a diameter between 24 and 26 millimeters and discard the rest. Then, I split the tubes into four equal parts using a small cleaver, and trim each piece down to 120 millimeters in length using a cane guillotine. I then allow the cane to soak in water overnight.</p>

        <p class="description description4">Testing Hardness</p>
        </div>
        <p class="instruction">Once the cane has been thoroughly soaked, I run it through my pre-gouging machine. This machine removes most of the pithy material from the inside of the cane, thus saving the blade of my gouging machine. I then gouge the cane with my gouging machine, which removes a finer amount of pithy material and leaves the inside of the cane smooth.</p>

        <p class="instruction">I check the curls of cane that come off the gouging machine and discard any pieces that produce rough or pock-marked curls. I gouge each piece to a thickness of at most 1.39 millimeters (and not thinner than 1.2 millimeters). A thinner gouge produces generally harder cane and a thicker gouge produces generally softer cane. I discard any pieces of gouged cane that are warped. I then set the cane to dry bark-side up for at least 4 days.</p>

        <p class="instruction">After drying, I discard any pieces that have curled into tight semi-circles. Flatter pieces produce more desirable tip-openings on finished reeds. I then test the hardness of each piece with my hardness tester. On a hardness tester higher numbers indicate softer pieces of cane, while lower numbers indicate harder pieces. Every hardness tester is different and individual tastes vary, but I prefer working with cane that registers on my machine as 19 or less. Pieces that register higher than this I gouge thinner, set aside to age for a few years if the piece is too thin to gouge again, or discard if the pieces is too thin to gouge and registers higher than 21. The reason I set aside some pieces to age is that cane will harden slowly over time.</p>

        <p class="description description3">Drying Blanks</P>

        </div>

        <p class="instruction">I soak the cane once again overnight before placing it in my straight shaper and shaving off the excess cane with an x-acto knife. I then place the cane onto my profiler machine and profile it to a thickness of .9 millimeters near the tube, .6 millimeters at 12.7 millimeters from the fold, and .5 millimeters at the fold. I leave the profile intentionally thick at the fold because I typically use a tip profiler to create a tip for my reeds. It is certainly possible to create a tip by hand and I recommend a thickness of .35 millimeters at the fold if that is your intention.</p>

        <p class="instruction">A profiler machine thins the piece of cane by removing material from the bark side (opposite of a gouger which removes material from the inside). I then score lines into the  bark tube of the profiled cane using a tap from a tap and die set, a razor blade works just as well. I only score all the way through the bark from about 3-4 millimeters above the butt. I then fold the piece of cane in half and wrap a piece of brass wire around the tube about 25.4 millimeters from the butt of the reed.</p>

        <p class="instruction">I make sure the wire is wrapped snugly around the tube with pliers. I wrap the reed with wet twine starting about halfway up the blade above the wire. I wrap the twine rather tightly above the wire and then loosely below the wire all the way down the tube and back up. I tie a half-hitch to keep the twine from unraveling.</p>

        <p class="instruction">I then insert my forming mandrel into the tube of the reed and push the reed as far onto the mandrel as it will go. I then round the tube aroud the mandrel with my pliers. Once the tube as been adequately rounded, I remove the reed from the mandrel and place it on the drying rack to dry for at least 24 hours. Letting the reed dry for 2 weeks or longer is preferrable.</p>

        <p class="description description2">Colorful Blanks</p>
      </div>
        <p class="instruction">After the reed has dried, I unwrap the twine and remove the wire. I then bevel the reed by rubbing the tube close to butt on a flat rectungular diamond file or a piece of sand paper. The idea is to flatten the edges of the tube so that the two halves will sit flush against each other and form a circle. I then put the reed on my mandrel and reapply the first wire at 25.4 millimeters. I put the third wire about 5 millimeter above the butt, and the second wire 8 millimeters below the first wire. I then wrap the reed.</p>

        <p class="instruction">There are multiple methods for wrapping reeds. I have used both thread and hot glue. I recommend using hot glue because it is quicker and easier. If using thread and Duco cement, let the reeds dry overnight after applying the Duco.</p>

        <p class="description description2">Finishing a Reed</p>
      </div>
        <p class="instruction">Once the wrapping has dried, I soak the reed in water fo 5 to 10 minutes. I then clip the tip of the reed 28 millimeters from the top of the first wire. I then profile the tip of the reed on my tip profiler machine. I profile to a thickness of .25mm in the center of the edge of the tip. At this point the reed is ready to be played in and adjusted over a period of several days. It may take up to a couple of weeks of small daily adjustments before the reed is ready to be played in rehearsal or performance settings.</p>
