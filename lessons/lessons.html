        <h2>Study with me</h2>


  <p>As a teacher, it is my goal to help students develop the musicianship necessary to becoming sensitive ensemble players and fantastic soloists. I will help you garner the tools you need to become a self-reliant and thoughtful musician. I can get you to the level of playing you need to get into the top music schools and conservatories.</p>
        <p>I take students ranging in experience from beginners to advanced high-school level musicians.</p>

        <p>I am available for one-on-one lessons, chamber ensemble coachings, reedmaking lessons (both in groups or one-on-one), and masterclasses. We can arrange to have lessons over Skype or in person (depending on your location).</p>
        <p>To discuss lessons or to schedule a 30 minute sample lesson contact me at (770)-375-1585 or <a href="mailto:HarterBassoon@gmail.com">HarterBassoon@gmail.com</a></p>
